# HANDOFF.md - New Conversation Handoff

Date: 2026-07-25
Workspace: `D:\yinsir`

This file is the latest operational state for a new Codex/agent session with no
chat history. Read these files before doing any project work:

1. `AGENTS.md` - durable repository, safety, and collaboration rules.
2. `AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` - authoritative machine execution contract.
3. `实验实施指导文档_综合版.md` - human-facing rationale and operational guide.
4. This `HANDOFF.md` - live status and next step.

If older docs conflict with this file on status chronology, this file is newer.
Hard rules in `AGENTS.md` and `AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` still apply.

## 1. What We Are Doing Now

We are preparing a practical SCI-Q4-oriented applied/engineering paper about
few-shot Chinese equipment-domain NER using a reproducible local-LLM extraction
pipeline.

Current task: **GPU-free paper writing and pre-submission preparation in
Markdown**.

Current editable paper draft:

- `docs/EQUIPMENT_IE_PAPER_DRAFT_V3_REVIEW_POLISH_20260725.md`

All generated `.docx` files were deleted on 2026-07-25 at the user's request
because of rendering/encoding problems. Future writing defaults to UTF-8
Markdown unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

No paid GPU, vLLM launch, dry-run, model call, frozen-test prompt generation, or
new experiment is currently authorized.

## 2. What Is Already Completed

### P0 - Environment

Complete.

- AutoDL environment was set up.
- Project venv and required imports passed previously.
- Four fixed model directories were downloaded and structurally checked:
  Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-AWQ, BGE-M3, and
  bge-reranker-v2-m3.
- P0 backup was created and hash-verified.
- The human confirmed the P0 image was saved.

### P1 - Public Data

Complete.

- CLUENER, Few-NERD SUP, DuIE 2.0, and CMNEE were downloaded and normalized.
- 12 official split JSONL files were generated.
- K=1/5/10 public support files were generated with seed 42.
- Loader/span checks passed.
- Important limitation: public CLUENER and DuIE test files have no gold labels.
  They must never be evaluated as all-negative gold.

### P2 - Self-Built Domain Data

Complete and frozen.

- 400 public equipment-domain candidates were collected:
  Baidu Baike 7, patent 84, CMNEE 309.
- Schema `p2-schema-draft-v1` and 10 synthetic examples were approved.
- QAonMilitaryKG distant supervision had low coverage:
  15/400 records, 23 EQUIPMENT suggestions, 0 relations.
- Qwen2.5-14B-AWQ proposal workflow, human review, adjudication, and freeze
  were completed for the approved 250-record route.
- Final frozen split:
  - `domain_support.jsonl`: 30 rows;
  - `domain_dev.jsonl`: 50 rows;
  - `domain_test.jsonl`: 170 rows;
  - `domain_rag_corpus.jsonl`: 230 rows;
  - `data/FROZEN` and `logs/dedup.json` exist in the remote artifact set.
- Important hashes:
  - `domain_gold_250.jsonl`:
    `fb183c733d328124c35e527872eb9cb4ea839fdf7bea1059c2313e3ea207acdc`;
  - `domain_support.jsonl`:
    `9633c7f6ceee8592408034e26834233e3f03b2f58a104783757ae664a4bab22a`;
  - `domain_dev.jsonl`:
    `ade6eda3547349117b5fa212c6567bd76722bb1996844b0de4f2d5a01ffc0c6b`;
  - `domain_test.jsonl`:
    `42f6ecbbfd1eb57937cd74a04e5b8362fe0976b5bf108e52523a4778dd53bfd0`.
- Local P2 gold backup:
  `backups/P2/p2_domain_gold_freeze_20260722.tar.gz`;
  SHA256 `a3711e2af4179d8398d8d497827ff703b1cfa4a8b0c05ea4de47837b9329ec3f`.

### P3/P4 - Domain-Dev Sanity

Complete enough for the current paper route.

All model-run cells below are `domain_dev50`, K=5, seed 42, Qwen2.5-7B via
vLLM.

| Config | Main change | Precision | Recall | F1 | TP/FP/FN | Verdict |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| A | fixed random, no glossary/RAG/verif | 0.4914 | 0.5570 | 0.5221 | 171/177/136 | accepted baseline |
| B | kNN examples | 0.4767 | 0.5342 | 0.5038 | 164/180/143 | negative |
| C | B replay + glossary | 0.4722 | 0.5537 | 0.5097 | 170/190/137 | mixed |
| D | C + RAG rerank top-3 | 0.5211 | 0.5635 | 0.5415 | 173/159/134 | positive |
| E v1 | D + verifier v1 | 0.6173 | 0.3257 | 0.4264 | 100/62/207 | overkill |
| E v2 | D + verifier v2 | 0.5266 | 0.5472 | 0.5367 | 168/151/139 | mixed |

Dev interpretation: D(RAG) was the strongest positive sanity result. Verifier
variants were negative or mixed and are not recommended for more paid GPU by
default.

### P5 - Bounded Domain-Test Evidence

Complete for a narrow paper claim, not complete as the original full P5 matrix.

Completed scope:

- Dataset: `domain_test`
- K: 5
- Seeds: 42, 43, 44
- Configs:
  - A: fixed random;
  - B: kNN examples;
  - C: kNN + glossary;
  - D: kNN + glossary + RAG.
- Not run/completed: E, E-prime, CLUENER, K=1, K=10, more seeds, full public
  benchmark matrix.

All 12 completed per-query/summary files under `results/p5/` were verified:
170 rows per cell, 0 parse failures, SHA256 matched during the prior audit.

Three-seed domain-test NER results:

| Config | F1 mean +/- std | FP mean +/- std | Main reading |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| A | `0.534645 +/- 0.004375` | `613.3 +/- 88.8` | baseline |
| B | `0.555169 +/- 0.000880` | `573.7 +/- 1.2` | kNN improves F1 and lowers FP |
| C | `0.568858 +/- 0.000769` | `584.0 +/- 0.0` | best F1/recall |
| D | `0.565764 +/- 0.000000` | `529.0 +/- 0.0` | best precision and lowest FP |

Clean deltas:

- `B - A`: +0.020524 F1 and about -39.7 FP.
- `C - B`: +0.013689 F1 and about +10.3 FP.
- `D - C`: -0.003094 F1, but about -55.0 FP.
- `D - A`: +0.031119 F1 and about -84.3 FP.

Accepted wording: **C and D are near-tied on F1; C is marginally ahead on
recall/F1, while D is clearly ahead on precision and false-positive reduction.
Do not write that C significantly or substantially beats D.**

P5 paid run note:

- The replication paid vLLM window was approximately
  2026-07-24 18:16:34-19:27:50 CST.
- Estimated cost was about 3.2 CNY at 2.7 CNY/hour.
- vLLM was stopped after the run and GPU memory was verified at 0 MiB.

## 3. Current Claim Boundary

Result-to-claim verdict: `partial`.

Supported claim:

> In a frozen low-label Chinese equipment-domain NER setting, kNN
> demonstrations and glossary injection improve entity extraction F1, while RAG
> evidence preserves near-tied F1 and improves precision / reduces
> false-positive entity predictions.

Not supported by current evidence:

- relation extraction success;
- CoVe/self-verification improvement;
- public benchmark generalization;
- K=1/K=10 robustness;
- full A..E-prime ablation matrix;
- supervised-SOTA-style claims;
- any claim that C significantly beats D.

Paper positioning:

- Main task: NER.
- RE: auxiliary background only unless new dev-first evidence is created later.
- Contribution style: applied/reproducible engineering pipeline plus small
  equipment-domain dataset and honest ablation evidence.
- Target: one-month SCI-Q4-oriented manuscript route, Chinese draft first and
  then English SCI manuscript.

## 4. Current Paper And Review Artifacts

Use these as the paper-facing evidence base:

- `docs/EQUIPMENT_IE_PAPER_DRAFT_V3_REVIEW_POLISH_20260725.md`
- `docs/RESULT_TO_CLAIM_P5_DOMAIN_20260725.md`
- `docs/P5_DOMAIN_PAPER_EVIDENCE_20260725.md`
- `docs/P5_PAPER_REVIEW_AUDIT_20260725.md`
- `docs/P5_PAPER_P0_REVIEW_FEEDBACK_20260725.md`
- `findings.md`
- `logs/p5_c_vs_d_fp_qualitative_20260725.json`
- `logs/p5_c_vs_d_fp_qualitative_20260725.csv`

P0 paper repair already completed:

- Added variance explanation: A has fixed-random example-selection noise;
  B/C/D use kNN/replay, so variance is much smaller.
- Added C-vs-D qualitative FP analysis:
  - D removes/avoids 181 C-only false positives;
  - D introduces 126 new false positives;
  - net FP reduction is 55;
  - major categories: unsupported entity 84, type/overlap 34, short alias/code
    25, boundary error 24, metric fragment 14.

## 5. Non-Negotiable Execution Rules

- Never run project Python locally on Windows.
- Windows `D:\yinsir` is only for editing, Git, SSH/SCP, documentation, and
  lightweight artifact checks.
- All Python, tests, data processing, inference, evaluation, and aggregation
  must run on AutoDL through SSH alias `autodl-paper`.
- Use AutoDL GPU-free/no-card mode for current work.
- Use paid GPU only for model inference/training and only after explicit human
  approval for one bounded step.
- After every GPU phase: stop vLLM, verify GPU memory returns to 0 MiB, back up,
  sync lightweight artifacts to `D:\yinsir`, report cost, and remind the human
  to shut down or switch to no-card mode.
- Never use `domain_test` for prompt tuning, glossary tuning, RAG tuning,
  threshold changes, or verification tuning.
- Do not run E/E-prime, CLUENER, K=1/K=10, full P5, more seeds, dry-runs, model
  calls, or new `domain_test` prompt generation without a new explicit gate.
- Preserve negative and mixed results; do not rerun them away.
- The real AutoDL host/port/passwords live only in the user's local SSH config.
  Use only the alias `autodl-paper` in docs and commands.

## 6. Repo And Machine Notes

Local:

- Workspace: `D:\yinsir`
- Branch: `main`
- Git remote: `https://github.com/QKY520/yinxin.git`
- Git identity for this repo: `yly <714520833@qq.com>`
- This handoff refresh is committed with message:
  `docs: refresh project handoff state`. Run `git log -1 --oneline` for the
  exact current hash.
- Previous local commit before this handoff refresh:
  `863c701 docs: replace generated docx drafts with markdown`
- GitHub push has recently failed because the local proxy `127.0.0.1` cannot
  connect. AutoDL SSH also returned connection refused during this refresh, so
  the latest handoff-refresh commit is currently local-only until GitHub or
  AutoDL connectivity is restored.

Remote:

- SSH alias: `autodl-paper`
- Remote code: `/root/project`
- Remote data/model/backup root: `/root/autodl-tmp`
- Project venv: `/root/autodl-tmp/venvs/equipment-ie`
- Last expected mode: GPU-free/no-card. Confirm before doing anything remote.

Useful no-Python status command:

```bash
ssh autodl-paper 'cd /root/project && git rev-parse --short HEAD && git status --short && (nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,name,memory.used,memory.total --format=csv,noheader 2>/dev/null || echo GPU_FREE_OR_NVIDIA_SMI_UNAVAILABLE)'
```

## 7. Recommended Next Step

Default next step is **no-card manuscript work**:

1. Continue editing the Markdown paper draft.
2. Tighten the abstract/introduction/results/conclusion around the scoped
   `partial` claim.
3. Keep C-vs-D wording honest: near-tie on F1, D stronger on precision and FP
   reduction.
4. Use `docs/P5_PAPER_P0_REVIEW_FEEDBACK_20260725.md` as the pre-submission
   checklist.
5. Optionally screen target SCI-Q4 journals and adapt the manuscript format.

Do not start any new experiment unless the human gives a new bounded gate. If a
future gate is approved, change only execution metadata for the approved scope
and keep prompt/glossary/RAG/verifier semantics unchanged unless the gate
explicitly authorizes a method change.

## 8. Lessons Worth Remembering

- The project is now paper-first, not experiment-first.
- The experiment is basically complete only for the narrow domain NER claim; it
  is not a complete full-matrix IE paper.
- C and D are a near-tie on F1. D's value is FP/precision reduction, not a large
  F1 gain.
- The stronger paper is the honest one: do not overclaim RE, CoVe, public
  generalization, or statistical significance.
- Glossary helps recall/F1 but can add false positives.
- RAG is slower because CPU embedding/reranking dominated D's wall time; future
  RAG runs need replay manifests or timing hygiene if more experiments are ever
  approved.
- P5 A/B/C/D were NER-only configs (`schema.task: ner`, empty relation types);
  zero relation predictions are expected and are not evidence that RE failed as
  a tested module.
- Verification v1/v2 over-killed or failed to beat D on dev. Keep it as a
  limitation/negative result unless new evidence is produced.
- AutoDL no-card mode may have tight memory limits. Avoid loading BGE-M3 unless
  needed; prefer cached/replay artifacts when they preserve comparisons.
- DOCX output caused encoding/rendering trouble in this workflow. Use Markdown
  as the working manuscript format.
- Backups and hashes matter. Never leave the only copy of data/results on the
  AutoDL instance.
- Every new paid action needs an explicit bounded human gate, even if it seems
  technically small.
